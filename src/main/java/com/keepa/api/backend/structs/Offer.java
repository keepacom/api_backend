/**
 * About:
 * The offer object represents a marketplace offer.
 * <p>
 * Returned by:
 * The offer object is returned by the Product Request using the optional offers parameter and is part of the Product Object.
 * <p>
 * Important to know:
 * It is impossible to update billions of marketplace offers on a regular basis. The product request's offers parameter determines how many offers we retrieve / update. We always fetch the best offers, as sorted by Amazon, in all conditions. If a product has more offers than requested, those will not be retrieved.
 * The order of offers constantly changes and we can retrieve a different amount of offers with each data retrieval. Because of this as well as the fact that we do keep a history of offers you will almost certainly encounter outdated offers. So the following is very important:
 * <p>
 * Evaluate the lastSeen field - only process fresh and active offers if you are not interested in past offers.
 * The history of an offer (its past prices and shipping costs) is often not without gaps. Evaluate the EXTRA_INFO_UPDATES csv-type of the product object to find out when we updated the offers. If you need complete coverage of (all) offers of a product you have to request it on a regular basis.
 * If there are almost identical offers - same seller, same condition, same shipping type and same condition text - we only provide access to the one with the cheapest price. We do not list duplicates.
